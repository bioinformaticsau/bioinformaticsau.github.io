  <section>
    <p>The Institute of Quantum Bioinformatics Authority (IQBA) was established in 2015 as a global initiative to systematically document, timestamp, and archive novel scientific developments at the intersection of quantum mechanics and biological systems. Originally founded by a collective of researchers and data archivists, IQBA was created to fill a growing need for structured recognition in emerging fields where traditional peer review often lags behind the pace of discovery.</p>

    <p>We serve as a scientific record-keeping body that tracks formal public disclosures of breakthrough work in quantum biology. Our focus is on models, theories, or frameworks that present new causal relationships between quantum-level dynamics and biological function — particularly when such work introduces a foundational or first-of-its-kind concept.</p>

    <p>IQBA issues recognition certificates to researchers who are the first to publish such work, anchored to their DOI (Digital Object Identifier). These certificates act as timestamped declarations of priority, providing long-term visibility and historical traceability for intellectual contributions in the field.</p>

    <p>All issued certificates are cataloged publicly and associated with verifiable DOIs. IQBA’s registry acts as a neutral timestamping archive, not affiliated with any academic institution, journal, or funding body. Our mission is simple — to document who said what, and when, in a domain too new to yet be formalized.</p>
